# identity

Authentication reverse proxy for managing internal resource access. Comes with Single Sign On buil-in. Best used for managing self-hosted utilities among multiple users (aka [homies](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Homies)).


## motivation

There are already lots of solutions for user and access control management. So I decided to add one. Seriously, all of them required additional maintenance or another software component to get everything I wanted. Also, with my own fine tuning I can get the results I want best for my own apps.

## features

- Non-customizable login page
- Admin interface
- User properties (claims) management
- Claims based authorization
- Single sign on (you need to type password only once to login multiple applications)

## getting started

The software is not at a stage where I feel confident to suggest you to use it, I may add more instructions if I ever get to smooth things out by putting some hours into it. If you want to try out, please open an issue describing your use case.

## license

Right now the software and its components is distributed with half-joke / half-serious proprietary license. I will change it with a proper license once the software gets into a stable stage. However, if you want to use it yourself, please open an issue with your use case.
